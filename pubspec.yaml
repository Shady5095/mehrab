  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/lang/
    - assets/json/
    - assets/audio/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:



  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600



    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Light.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Regular.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 900


    - family: Amiri
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/AmiriQuran-Regular.ttf
          weight: 500

    - family: IconBroken
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/icons.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
